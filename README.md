## Introduction

Hi, and welcome to this introduction to AI course! Where we usually go very deep into one particular subject in these courses, for this one we'll take a different approach and go very broad instead. We'll cover the basics of a lot of different AI implementation-related topics, showing you how to implement and use them to your advantage. While this information alone will be very helpful for you in today's AI-centric world and how to leverage AI for your benefit, it doesn't stop there.

This course will be kind of like a menu card at a restaurant. You'll get a taste of a lot of different dishes, so you can very easily see exactly what is out there, and then if you like one of them and want to have more, we have a full course on that particular dish. For all the topics we will be covering here, we also have a full course that goes much deeper into the subject, so you can easily learn more on each topic afterward as you see fit.

In part 1, we will cover how to use ChatGPT programmatically using Python. After that, part 2 will cover the other APIs available, covering image generation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text transcription. Part 3 covers LangChain, which allows us to chain all of this together in an organized manner.

The 4th part uses Gradio, which will allow us to make a quick and easy user interface for our AI models. Part 5 will cover running LLMs and AI models locally, also having a look at HuggingFace. Finally, in part 6 we will wrap up by having a look at the equally powerful Google Gemini LLM and its capabilities.

Just following the basics laid out in this course will give you a very solid base to work from even if you don't take any of the more in-depth courses afterwards. Just knowing the basics well is already a huge benefit in daily life, so no pressure! Enjoy the ride, see it as an exploration of the AI world, and if any particular topic catches your interest, you'll find out!

Let's get started!
